# Introduction
This is a microblogging and social networking app for sharing recipes. Users can view a list of recipes as posts, or upload, modify or delete posts on the platform. \
GET and POST requests are sent via AJAX requests. A RESTful API is constructed to enable data fetching from the designated endpoints.\  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
